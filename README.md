you should make backups of your host file before using this application in the circumstance that ðŸ¦‰ deletes

## Key Features

* Use Projects for every hostname you're interested in tracking.
* Create Environments for your Projects which point at specific IP addresses.
* Automatic importing of current host files.
* Cross platform - Windows, macOS and Linux ready.
* Pretty as fuck.
* Easy to use, blah blah.
