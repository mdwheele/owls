## Disclaimer :fire:

I'm actively developing this application, which means that if you don't trust me (you shouldn't), 
you should make backups of your host file before using this application in the circumstance that ðŸ¦‰ deletes
everything.

You've been warned. On with the show.

## Key Features

* Use Projects for every hostname you're interested in tracking.
* Create Environments for your Projects which point at specific IP addresses.
* Automatic importing of current host files.
* Cross platform - Windows, macOS and Linux ready.
* Pretty as fuck.
* Easy to use, blah blah.
